Can be used for whatever purposes, only thing I ask is to credit me if you decide to add this into your own LVM project

---HOW TO INSTALL---

1. Extract the adam_099 folder to the following directory.
server\store\3a981f5cb2739137\cc_store\family\upper_body

2. Refer to the previous folder (server\store\3a981f5cb2739137\cc_store\family) and open cc_theme.xml with a file editor. (Notepad for example)

3. Scroll down until you find one of these lines of code.
<component type="upper_body" id="adam_001" path="adam_001" name="adam_001" thumb="thumbnail.swf">...

4. Enter a new line either above or below what was previously found and copy and paste the following into the new line.

        <component type="upper_body" id="adam_099" path="adam_099" name="adam_099" thumb="thumbnail.swf" display_order="180" money="0" sharing="0" enable="Y">
