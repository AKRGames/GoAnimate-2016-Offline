--HOW TO INSTALL--

1. Extract the 0xx folder from the ZIP folder to 
(location of your wrapper folder)/wrapper-offline/server/store/3a981f5cb2739137/cc_store/cc2/GoBehindBody

2. Rename the 0xx files to any number that has not been used yet.

3. Go to the cc2 folder and open cc_theme.xml with Notepad or any program that can edit XML files.

4. Scroll down until you find one of the following:
		<library type="GoBehindBody" id="0xx" path="0xx" name="0xx" thumb="0xx_thumbnail.swf" display_order="10" money="0" sharing="0" enable="Y">
			<tag>_userrole_admin</tag>

5. Copy the whole component, create a new line, and replace the "xx" with the number you set the Tabby Cat / Ring Tailed Lemur Tail folder to.

6. You're done! Go to the Character Creator on Wrapper online and the Tabby Cat / Ring Tailed Lemur Tail should be there!
