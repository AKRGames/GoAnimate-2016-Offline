Created by AntiTrooperProductions UTTP

--HOW TO INSTALL--

1. Extract the adam_a0xx folder from the ZIP folder to 
(location of your wrapper folder)/wrappr-offline/server/store/3a981f5cb2739137/cc_store/family/upper_body

2. Rename the adam_a0xx folder to any number that has not been used yet. MAKE SURE TO KEEP THE "ADAM_" PART!

3. Go to the family folder and open cc_theme.xml with Notepad or any program that can edit XML files.

4. Scroll down until you find one of the following:
		<component type="upper_body" id="adam_0xx" path="adam_0xx" name="adam_0xx" thumb="thumbnail.swf" display_order="100" money="0" sharing="0" enable="Y">
			<state id="chuckle" filename="chuckle.swf"/>
			<state id="crossed_arms" filename="crossed_arms.swf"/>
			<state id="dance" filename="dance.swf"/>
			<state id="default" filename="default.swf"/>
			<state id="excited" filename="excited.swf"/>
			<state id="fearful" filename="fearful.swf"/>

			<state id="talk_on_phone" filename="talk_on_phone.swf"/>
			<state id="taunt" filename="taunt.swf"/>
			<state id="walk" filename="walk.swf"/>
		</component>
5. Copy the whole component, create a new line, and replace the "xx" with the number you set the Lab Coat folder to.

6. You're done! Go to the Character Creator on Wrapper online and the Lab Coat should be there!
