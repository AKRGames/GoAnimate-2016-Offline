# GoAnimate 2016: Offline
Improvement of a major improvement of a GoAPI server wrapper designed to interact with Vyond's Legacy Video Maker.

## What stands out to the original Wrapper: Offline
Um, well, it has Buisness Friendly!

### But that's illegal!
Fuck you, we are pirates and pirates are free.

#### I'm telling Vyond!
**Don't you fucking dare.**

Anyway, whatever themes we have, it's all *theirs*.

Further information is inside this long repository.

## About the creator
The creator of this improvement of Wrapper: Offline is MapidsFanAnimate2006#2658. He puts the first letter of each word capitalized, I guess.

## And if Chromium doesn't work...
It's not my fault. Some of the files can't fit in here because the path is too large. You have to get the MEGA file link, which is outdated.
