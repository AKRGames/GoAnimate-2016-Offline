This folder contains the source code for any compiled binary files packaged with Wrapper: Offline. The version should match up with the one used by W:O. None of these have been modified, beyond recompressing them with 7z to reduce bloat. This is for anyone who wishes to modify and study them, most users do not need this. You're free to use and modify these under their respective licenses.

Programs that already run from their source code, such as batch scripts, are not included in this folder.
