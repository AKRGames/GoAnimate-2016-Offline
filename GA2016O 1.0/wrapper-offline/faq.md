# GoAnimate 2016: Offline
Created by: MapidsFanAnimate // VyonderDude2006

## What is GoAnimate 2016: Offline?
It's a clone of Wrapper: Offline, but with extra stuff added.

## Does it have the non-business themes?
Yes, it does have the non-business themes. (obviously)

## Does it have the GoAnimate watermarks from 2006 to 2018?
Yes, it does have that! (obviously)

## Does the visual effects work on the scene settings?
Nope, it doesn't have it, but it has it on the Common props.

## Does it have Business Friendly?
Yes, it does have Business Friendly! (obviously)

## Why doesn't Whiteboard Animation work?
Because it doesn't exist.

## Wait! You're using Vyond's shit! That's illegal!
We are using their copyrighted material, yes. I don't think there's any denying that. But I'm trying to avoid hurting Vyond. I already removed all the themes used in current Vyond (business friendly, whiteboard, etc) because I don't want to intrude on their user base (this was re-added into GA2016O), and I removed their branding as best as I could to separate this project from them and show that we aren't affiliated in any way. I've also added a disclaimer when starting Offline for the first time to make people fully aware of what they're going into. If people want a solid fast engine with professional themes, they'll go to Vyond, and I know there are people that genuinely use their service for business purposes. If people just want to make silly YouTube videos using themes they're nostalgic for, or want to see a historical archive of these old abandoned themes, they'll come here. The way I see it, the content in Offline has all been abandoned and mostly given a negative image  (grounded videos) that makes them avoided, and this is a way for us to preserve them for future people to learn about. By the time the copyright expires, nobody will care enough to preserve it. And I'm a strong believer that software should be preserved once it's been abandoned. If I download and play an old game that's no longer being sold officially, they've already stopped people from giving them money for it. I view this the exact same way. An obscure Garfield puzzle game from a decade ago only a few people remember deserves the same preservation as a famous game everyone played when it released. I've said it before, and I'll keep saying it for likely the rest of my life.

## When was it released?
October 15th, 2020.

## How do I start it?
Click start_wrapper.bat, and you'll see a disclaimer (you'll not see it the next time you start). Wait 20 seconds, and then press "y" and enter. 

## It is patchable?
Obviously not, just don't put a image file called "patch.jpg".

## Can we import?
You obviously can. It's here since the original Wrapper: Offline added it!
