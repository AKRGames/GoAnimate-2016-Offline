# GoAnimate 2016: Offline FAQ
Created by: [CoolDiamondDude9999](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCMNtr52qe9mGmmntXTnyXUw)

## What is GoAnimate 2016: Offline?
It's a clone of Wrapper: Offline, but with extra stuff added.

## Does it have the non-business themes?
Yes, it does have the non-business themes. (obviously)

## Does it have the GoAnimate watermarks from 2006 to 2018?
Yes, it does have that! (obviously)

## Does the visual effects work on the scene settings?
Nope, it doesn't have it, but it has it on the Common props.

## Does it have Business Friendly?
Yes, it does have Business Friendly! (obviously)

## Why doesn't Whiteboard Animation work?
Because it doesn't exist.

## Wait! You're using Vyond's shit! That's illegal!
We are using their copyrighted material, yes. I don't think there's any denying that. But I'm trying to avoid hurting Vyond. I've added a disclaimer when starting GA2016O for the first time to make people fully aware of what they're going into. If people want a solid fast engine with professional themes, they'll go to Vyond, and I know there are people that genuinely use their service for business purposes. If people just want to make silly YouTube videos using themes they're nostalgic for, or want to see a historical archive of these old abandoned themes, they'll come here. The way I see it, the content in GA2016O has all been abandoned and mostly given a negative image (grounded videos) that makes them avoided, and this is a way for us to preserve them for future people to learn about. By the time the copyright expires, nobody will care enough to preserve it. And I'm a strong believer that software should be preserved once it's been abandoned. If I download and play an old game that's no longer being sold officially, they've already stopped people from giving them money for it. I view this the exact same way. An obscure Garfield puzzle game from a decade ago only a few people remember deserves the same preservation as a famous game everyone played when it released. I've said it before, and I'll keep saying it for likely the rest of my life.

## When was it released?
October 15th, 2020.

## How do I start it?
Click `start_wrapper.bat`, and you'll see a disclaimer (you won't see it the next time you start). Wait 20 seconds, and then press *y* and *Enter*. 

## It is patchable?
Obviously not, just don't put a image file called `patch.jpg`.

## Can we import files?
You obviously can. It's here since the original Wrapper: Offline added it!

### How can I import files?
In the `start_wrapper.bat` prompt window, press *2* and *Enter*. Then, while holding *Shift*, right-click  the file that you want (*.png*, *.jpg*, *.mp3*, *.wav*, *.swf*) and click on "Copy as path" (make sure that your file name has no spaces, or else it won't work). Paste the path on the prompt window and press *Enter*. Then, choose the name that will appear in the video maker, and press *Enter*. After that, you have to choose what kind of image/sound it is.
- If you're importing a *.mp3*/*.wav* file, you have the option to either import it as music or a sound effect.
- If you're importing a *.png*/*.jpg* file, you have the option to either import it as a backdrop or a prop. If you choose to import as a prop, you will be asked to import the prop as either a holdable prop, a headgear, or a regular prop.
- If you're wanting to import a *.swf* file, it **must** have an image or a sound. If it doesn't have that, the file will be in the `utilities\import_these\conflicts` and the `server\store\3a981f5cb2739137\import\conflicts` folder.

Sometimes (maybe always) the importing doesn't work. So you must put your file in the `server\store\3a981f5cb2739137\import\sound` or the `...\prop` or the`...\bg` folders.
